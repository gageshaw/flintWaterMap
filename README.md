# flintWaterMap

This repository holds programs for graphing water quality data for City of Flint, Michigan.
Graph generators for different water quality heuristics can be found in their respective directories.
They take as input two seperate Microsoft Excel files containing:
1) measurement values from sites 
2) goegraphical coordinate of the measurement sites

Examples of how these Excel files are formated can be found in the directory exampleData.

Below are three plots generated using this software.
